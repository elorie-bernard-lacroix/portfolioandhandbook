        <h1> engineering, design, and engineering design</h1>
        <p>
          I see <strong>design</strong> as the process of creating something to serve a purpose. It involves understanding a need, creating, and sometimes
           reiterating. Regardless of whether the process is messy, organized, done individually, or in groups, I do not believe there is 
           a fair way of characterizing something as being more “design” than another. Anything that fits the previous criteria, I just see
            as design. This definition is largely based on my experiences with robotics competitions, hackathons, and now Praxis, where I saw 
            mind-blowing products that were all made through very different processes. This showed me that each process and structure for
             design fit different personalities. The one thing all these design projects shared, however, was a purpose and the process 
             of creation.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Engineering</strong> is a subset of design that involves the application of the natural sciences and mathematics to any part of the 
          design process. For example, a data engineer might not engage in the entire design process but by gathering data on a product, 
          they see what is effective and what is not, which contributes to the reiteration process. Data engineers could also be assessing 
          the needs of a targeted community which would tie into the framing part of the design process. Some may argue the necessity of the 
          natural sciences and mathematics in engineering, but as a student in an engineering program who uses mathematics and science in 
          every course to date, I see it as obligatory. After all, it is a degree of “applied science”. 
          <br><br>
          <strong>Engineering design</strong> is the process of design that involves the application of the natural sciences as a whole. Therefore, 
          unlike engineering, it would never refer to only a part of the design process, but instead the design process from start to 
          finish. This would include, at the very minimum, the identification of a need and the creation of a product to fulfill that 
          need. I do believe that this product would absolutely require the application of science or math to fulfill the “engineering” 
          aspect of the word.
          <br><br>
          I engage in engineering because I enjoy creating and want to make the world around me a better place. Even as a young child, 
          I have always been a caring person who found fulfillment and happiness through helping those in need. Of course, a lot of 
          disciplines help others but I am interested in long-lasting effects (like products that leave a legacy) and I also love how 
          engineering often involves the combination of several areas of knowledge to make the best results. Engineers need to 
          combine their unique experiences, creativity, knowledge of science, and a people-oriented approach to succeed and I want to 
          embody that.

    <div class="position__content" id = "values">
      <h1> values, biases, and assumptions </h1>

      <h2> language, interpretation, and communication </h2>
      <p> My experiences with language and communication have shaped the way I communicate, interpret other perspectives, and build my own 
        perspective of the world around me. I was raised in two languages, French and English. Growing up with the freedom of expressing 
        myself and seeing the world through both has always made communication in only one of the two languages seem limiting. I am 
        therefore hyper-aware of just how much language can shape our interpretation of the world. It can even decide what exists to us 
        and what we ignore since certain things simply don't have words assigned to them in a language. Even minor details, like the fact 
        that a bridge is a masculine noun in French, can affect our perception. In my experience, francophones have a tendency to describe 
        bridges as strong and sturdy, rather than beautiful and elegant like speakers of other languages who have it as a feminine noun. 
        My languages, along with my formal education, and perhaps my philosophy books as well, have taught me that there is no way for us 
        to truly understand or communicate what reality is. As soon as we try to, it becomes an interpretation. 
      
        <br>
        <br>
        This is why when I approach opportunities in engineering, my interpretation of stakeholder needs may be limited by our means of 
        communication, my inherent biases due to my languages (or even our different use of the same language), and the way certain topics 
        are usually addressed in my culture. This is why I tend to communicate through more than one language (if possible), through 
        metaphors, art, photos, diagrams, and other mediums. It fills in the gaps of things that simply can’t be expressed through language 
        alone and may overcome the limitations of language. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2> positive change: community, environmentalism, social equity </h2>
      <p>
        I believe communities need people to exist and people need communities in order to give them a sense of meaning. One of the things 
        that drive my interest in engineering is to serve my community and make it a better place for everyone. Therefore, I try to 
        incorporate it into everything I do. In engineering, this usually translates to making accessibility, affordability, and safety 
        a priority in our objectives, as you will see in my Praxis II projects. This need has also specifically branched out into 
        social equity and environmentalism. 
        <br>
        <br>

        As a woman in engineering and a person who has worked with people of diverse backgrounds, I have developed a deep appreciation 
        for diversity and the inclusion of all people, from all backgrounds. After researching the effects of engineering for only specific
         demographics and being educated on the negative impacts of past settler-colonial projects, I want to make sure I account for women 
         and other minorities in opportunity identification, research, and throughout the design process. 
        <br>
        <br>

        Like most people my age, I have been raised in an era with the constant threat of environmental issues and my education on these 
        topics probably surpasses that of many generations before mine. Because of this, I have become very considerate of the 
        environment, and this extends to my practice of engineering, namely it has increased my willingness to design for the environment
         and for our future.

      </p>
      <br>

      <h2> curiosity and willingness to listen </h2>
      <p> 

        I value reading and learning about the world and the people around me. Although my grandfather never finished his high school education, he 
        is one of the smartest people I know and he loves to read newspapers. Fortunately, with all the time I have spent with him and the 
        articles he has encouraged me to read, he passed down his love for reading and the value of life-long learning to me. When I practice 
        engineering, I listen and read a lot before acting. With this, he also taught me that listening to others regardless of their 
        educational background or age is the most important part of being a kind and respectful leader. Over the course of my first year 
        in engineering science, I have been privileged enough to work with one of the most diverse groups of people I have ever met. Some 
        come from different countries, many practice different religions, most people speak different languages, and all of them have taught me 
        something new and valuable about engineering or about life.
        I want to bring this value to the 
        table by fully understanding what people want and need or why problems are occurring before tackling an engineering opportunity.

    <!-- Strengths and Weaknesses -->

    <div class="position__content" id="strengthweak">
      <h1>strengths & weaknesses</h1>
      <h2> strengths </h2>
      <p> <strong>Listening to understand:</strong> As mentioned earlier, I love listening and learning more about the people and the world around me.
      Because I put a lot of effort into understanding other people's ideas, I tend to be good at integrative thinking, where we combine
    the ideas of multiple group members into one main concept. </p>

      <p> <strong>Trying new things: </strong>I've always loved trying new things. When new projects come along and I see an opportunity to 
      learn a new coding language, a framework, a new platform, I am always eager to jump in and figure it out.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h2> weaknesses </h2>
      <p> <strong>Speaking:</strong> Throughout Praxis II, I have noticed that it takes me a while to feel comfortable enough to share
      my ideas, especially verbally. Instead I continue to listen to others and wait until my ideas are fully fleshed out. This can hinder 
    my groups in stages like diverging, where pitching in any small points can lead to great ideas. To overcome this, the use of structured 
  diverging tools is very helpful. I also like to build a good foundation of psychological safety with the rest of my group to feel like
all of us can share anything without feeling judged. </p>
